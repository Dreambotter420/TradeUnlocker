# Instructions how to do it like a 3 yr old retarded child if on Windows (can't help Mac or Linux sry):

Make sure your PC is on! If you can read this, you know your PC is on. Next step:

Login to your dreambot account on dreambot.org, then head over to the Scripts SDN section, and add "tmp's 10 QP". It's free, so why not?

Download the file "tradeunlocker.jar" by clicking up above on "Clone" -> "Download ZIP". Then look for the ZIP file you just downloaded.

Then you can double-click the ZIP file by pressing left-mouse button twice in rapid succession after you move the mouse around a bit to get the cursor over the icon. When you do that, you will see a folder "TradeUnlocker-main" and double click that too. 

Hold with me here, you have to open a new folder. That's right you are already viewing a folder but you need to open a new one. Hold the buttons on your keyboard at the same time: Windows Key + E. Now in your new window navigate to YOUR USERNAME FOLDER! That's right you have a username folder. It's probably in your C:\ drive but maybe not. Just click around some folders until you get to it, then double-click the folder "DreamBot" inside your username folder. Then double-click the "Scripts" folder. 

The click left mouse button over the "tradeunlocker.jar" AND DO NOT LET GO!!! If you let go you must try again. Move your mouse inside of the "Scripts" folder. Now you can let go. In fact if you do not let go now it will not work.

 Then start Dreambot client and start script in your Script Manager "TradeUnlocker".

# Instructions how to do it if you aren't like a 3 yr old retarded child

Build the script using an IDE like Eclipse after launching the dreambot updater "DBLauncher.jar" and adding external jar "client.jar" in DreamBot\BotData, then export to folder Dreambot\Scripts. Supports quickstart (no params). A pre-built .jar file is included but is optional.
